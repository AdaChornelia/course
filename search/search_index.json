You can\n    find the tutorial and user guide of DeepView\n    \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload to the archive \nPDB_files_part6.zip\n and unzip it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might find 8 PDB files in the directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen them with DeepView.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the secondary structure representation mode (see part\n    VII-A-5 and/or the user guide).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nTry to identify the structures corresponding to X and Y proteins.\n\n\n\n\nVII - Tridimensional protein structure: Play with 3D structures using SwissPDBViewer (DeepView)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the \nProtein Data Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch and download the following PDB files: 1CRN, 1LDM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will visualize these protein structures using DeepView\n\n\nA - Analyze protein structures with DeepView\n\n\n1. Load a 3D structure\n\n\nFile => Open\n\n\nChoose the 1CRN.pdb file that you have downloaded from the PDB.\n\n\n2. Visualize the number of chains\n\n\nIs it only the protein or can we find ligands? Is it a monomer or a\npolymer?\n\n\n3. Visualize the general shape\n\n\nTry to get the actual space taken by the molecule. You need to use the\ncontrol panel and use the ':v' column to activate the space-filling\nspheres representation (+ menu Display > Render in solid 3D).\n\n\nTest also the Slab mode to visualize the space within the molecule:\nDisplay > Slab\n\n\n4. Display a distance between 2 atoms, angle between 3 atoms\n\n\nUse the graphical panel. You can now measure the real dimensions of your\nprotein\n\n\n5. Visualize secondary structure elements\n\n\nIn the control panel, activate \"ribbon\" (rbn). You can also color the\nmolecule by secondary structures.\n\n\n6. Visualize ligands (if there is any)\n\n\nSelect and color them. You could also remove the rest, or better, have a\nlook at the residues that are around those ligands (radius function in\nthe graphical panel).\n\n\n7. Analysis of other protein structures\n\n\nThe teacher will give PDB codes of other structures to analyze. Choose\nDeepView or Rasmol/Jmol to do so, that is up to you!\n\n\nB - Optional: if you want to use RasMol/Jmol\n\n\n1. Load a 3D structure\n\n\nFile => Open\n\n\nChoose the 1CRN.pdb file that you have downloaded from the PDB.\n\n\n\n\nHELP SECTION FOR RASMOL\n\n\nMolecule main moves with the mouse:\n\n\nLeft button: XY rotation\n\n\nLeft button + Shift: Zoom\n\n\nRight button: Translation\n\n\nRight button + Shift: Z rotation\n\n\nKeep the graphical window and the command (text) window on your screen\n(> \u200b\u200bis a command to type in the text window).\n\n\nFor each selection (SELECT command), the number of selected atoms\nappears in the text window. After you can apply an action to be able to\nvisualize the elements that you have selected (e.g. COLOR GREEN).\n\n\nCtrl+Z does not exist in Rasmol. You can type the command RESET.\n\n\nIf you want to come back in a standard representation of your molecule,\ntype:\n\n\nSELECT ALL\n\nCPK\n\n\n\n\n=> This will reset previous actions on representation modes (but keep\ncolors). CPK: space-filling spheres representation\n\n\nCOLOR CPK: colors \\'atom\\' objects by the atom (element) type\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp for Jmol:\n\n\nA lot of \"actions\" (color, selection...) are available by right clicking\non the main screen\n\n\nTo get the terminal window: menu File > Console\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Example: visualize the disulfide bonds\n\n\nType in the text window\n\n\nSELECT CYS\n\n\n\n\nThe text window \\\"answers\\\" 36 atoms selected (selected cysteine's\natoms)\n\n\nCOLOR GREEN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve the graphics window.\n\n\n\n\nRESTRICT CYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare with the SELECT command\n\n\n\n\nHighlight the disulfide bonds:\n\n\nSSBONDS\n\nCOLOR YELLOW\n\nSSBONDS 75\n\nCOLOR CPK\n\n\n\n\n3. Visualize secondary structure elements\n\n\nSSBONDS OFF (remove SS bonds)\n\nSELECT ALL\n\nCARTOONS\n\nCOLOR STRUCTURE\n\n\n\n\n4. Display a distance between 2 atoms\n\n\nActivate the compute distance mode typing:\n\n\nSET PICKING DISTANCE\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can click the 2 atoms.\n\n\nYou can display angle values typing:\n\n\nSET PICKING ANGLE\n\n\n\n\nThen pick the 3 atoms\n\n\n5. Other useful commands\n\n\nSHOW SEQUENCE\n\nSHOW INFO\n\nSELECT ALL\n\nCPK ON\n\nRESTRICT NOT HOH (remove water molecules)\n\nCPK OFF\n\nHBONDS\n\nSELECT CYCLIC AND NOT PRO\n\nSTEREO ON\n\n\n\n\nTry them to better understand the Rasmol command language.\n\n\n6. Store a command script and reload it\n\n\nRepeat the actions described in paragraph 2\n\n\nWRITE SCRIPT MY_SCRIPT.SC\n\n\n\n\nExit the software (File => Quit)\n\n\nRestart the software\n\n\nSOURCE MY_SCRIPT.SC\n\n\n\n\n7. Select the atoms in a sphere\n\n\nFile => Close\n\n\nLoad the file 1LDM.pdb\n\n\nDiscover and analyze the molecule (number of channels, ligands, \netc\n.)\n\n\nTo select all the atoms in a 3\u00c5 radius sphere centered on a ligand\n(\ne.g.\n NAD)\n\n\nSELECT ALL\n\nCOLOR CHAIN\n\nSELECT WITHIN (3.0, NAD)\n\nCPK\n\n\n\n\nOption => Slab Mode (comment).",
