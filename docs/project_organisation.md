## Project organization and management tutorial

This tutorial is inspired from Datacarpentry tutorial

### About the structure or architecture of your bioinformatics project


Some good practice when you will organise your project directory on the server, on the cloud or any other machine where you will compute:

Create 3 or 4 different directories within you project directory (use `mkdir`):

`data/` for keeping the raw data

`results/` for all the outputs from the multiple analyses that you will perform

`docs/` for all the notes written about the analyses carried out (ex: `history > 20180125.logs` for the commands executed today)

`scripts/` for all the scripts that you will use to produce the results


Here you can find a tutorial to practice:

!!! note
    You should always have the raw data in (at least) one place and not modify them

### More about data structure and metadata
